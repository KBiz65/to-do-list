## Summary

Creating a to-do list was a really fun thing to do. I hadn't worked with local storage before and this gave me a perfect opportunity to learn the ins and outs of it. It took me approximately a week to complete although I could have completed it a bit quicker. I took some extra time to have a clear understanding of how to save, retrieve, modify, and clear data from local storage. 

The app also gave me a chance to continue learning how to interact with the HTML page. One of my favorite parts of building this was creating elements in the HTML file and starting add and remove those elements by using Javascript.
